[00:00:00 --> 00:00:02]
Today, I'm sick and tired of these spam calls that keep coming.

[00:00:02 --> 00:00:04]
This video is the final summary of completely blocking methods.

[00:00:04 --> 00:00:07]
Seriously, these days, calls even come from numbers beginning with '010', so it's not just a matter of falling for it once or twice.

[00:00:07 --> 00:00:08]
Since we don't have time, let's get to the first point right away.

[00:00:08 --> 00:00:11]
These kinds of legitimate calls come due to these option selections that we carelessly agreed to when signing up for various memberships.

[00:00:11 --> 00:00:14]
But cases like this can actually be easily blocked.

[00:00:14 --> 00:00:17]
To block these calls, you simply need to search for '두낫콜' online right now.

[00:00:17 --> 00:00:19]
Then, you'll see two identical sites pop up.

[00:00:19 --> 00:00:22]
The site that ends with '.or.kr' is for blocking calls from banks, insurance companies, and financial institutions.

[00:00:22 --> 00:00:24]
While the one ending with '.geo.kr' below is for blocking telemarketing sales calls and other types.

[00:00:24 --> 00:00:27]
You just need to visit each site and register for '두낫콜' and opt-out of receiving calls.

[00:00:27 --> 00:00:29]
Secondly, it's about political or public opinion survey spam.

[00:00:29 --> 00:00:31]
This one is much simpler.

[00:00:31 --> 00:00:33]
Simply make a call once to your telecom company, following the number you see currently.

[00:00:33 --> 00:00:36]
"Hello. Opt-out of providing confidential numbers."

[00:00:36 --> 00:00:38]
Upon this, an automatic response will come up, ensuring you don't receive these calls anymore.

[00:00:38 --> 00:00:39]
And thirdly, real illegal spam calls.

[00:00:39 --> 00:00:41]
This is realistically the biggest problem, as the leaked information or randomly sent messages cannot be prevented at the root.

[00:00:41 --> 00:00:43]
However, there is one way.

[00:00:43 --> 00:00:46]
It is to use the free app called '후후' (HuHu).

[00:00:46 --> 00:00:48]
So, in the way around it, with over 10 million users already utilizing it, once you install it, you can quickly confirm the spam status when you receive calls from unknown numbers and instantly block them.

[00:00:48 --> 00:00:50]
Even if it's not spam, you can confirm the number and the name associated with it, adding more convenience.

[00:00:50 --> 00:00:52]
And nowadays, with all the voice phishing issues going on,

[00:00:52 --> 00:00:54]
When you receive calls from official bank numbers nationwide,

[00:00:54 --> 00:00:56]
Their logos will be displayed separately,

[00:00:56 --> 00:00:59]
allowing you to immediately discern if it's a legitimate number.

[00:00:59 --> 00:01:00]
Oh, and finally, a great tip.

[00:01:00 --> 00:01:02]
When you scroll down on your home screen, you'll see the real-time spam ranking here.

[00:01:02 --> 00:01:04]
By clicking on it, you'll see the numbers with the highest spam index.

[00:01:04 --> 00:01:06]
Firstly, click on 'Block All' here.

[00:01:06 --> 00:01:08]
Then proceed to report the type of call and

[00:01:08 --> 00:01:11]
block all the top 10 spam calls of each type, as displayed.

[00:01:11 --> 00:01:12]
Once you do these steps, you'll notice a significant decrease in calls,

[00:01:12 --> 00:01:15]
so I highly recommend following these procedures.
